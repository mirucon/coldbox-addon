## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I access to AMP pages?

You may access AMP page by adding "?amp=1" at the end of your articles URL. When visitors use Google search on mobile, they will automatically access to your AMP pages.

### Where are the share buttons shown?

By default, share buttons will be shown at the end of article content. Use `sns_buttons` shortcode to show them wherever you want in an article.
You can also use `<?php cd_addon_sns_buttons_list(); ?>` function to show them on any template files.

If you don't want the buttons to show at the end of content automatically, go and uncheck "Use social buttons" option in the theme customizer. You can call the share buttons using the shortcode function in that case.
